# Security Considerations

This document outlines the security measures and considerations for the Public WiFi Login Tool.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. URL Validation
- All user-provided URLs are validated before processing
- Only HTTP and HTTPS schemes are allowed
- Malformed URLs are rejected

### 2. Controlled Browser Environment
- Chrome browser runs with limited privileges
- Extensions and plugins are disabled
- Web security is maintained (removed dangerous `--disable-web-security` flag)
- Uses safer alternatives for handling insecure content

### 3. Input Sanitization
- User inputs are stripped of whitespace
- Basic validation prevents malicious URL injection
- Error handling prevents crashes from malformed input

### 4. Container Security (Docker)
- Runs as non-root user
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Network isolation through Docker
- Temporary files are cleaned up

### 5. File Protection
- `.gitignore` prevents accidental commit of sensitive files
- Screenshots and logs are excluded from version control
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

## Security Risks and Mitigations

### ⚠️ Known Risks

1. **Public WiFi Security**
   - **Risk**: Man-in-the-middle attacks, fake portals
   - **Mitigation**: Clear warnings, only use on trusted networks

2. **HTTP vs HTTPS**
   - **Risk**: Unencrypted traffic on public networks
   - **Mitigation**: Tool supports both, user decides based on trust

3. **Browser Automation**
   - **Risk**: Potential for malicious websites to exploit automation
   - **Mitigation**: Controlled environment, limited permissions

4. **Network Access**
   - **Risk**: Tool needs network access to detect portals
   - **Mitigation**: Only accesses known portal detection URLs

### ✅ Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Tool only requests necessary permissions
   - Browser runs with minimal privileges

2. **Transparency**
   - All actions are logged
   - Users can see what the tool is doing
   - Clear warnings about security implications

3. **Isolation**
   - Docker containers provide isolation
   - No access to host system beyond network

4. **Validation**
   - All inputs are validated
   - URLs are checked before processing
   - Error handling prevents crashes

## Usage Recommendations

### ✅ Safe Usage
- Use on trusted networks (airports, hospitals, known businesses)
- Verify portal URLs before entering credentials
- Use VPN for additional security when possible
- Don't enter sensitive information (banking, passwords)

### ❌ Unsafe Usage
- Using on unknown/untrusted networks
- Entering sensitive credentials without verification
- Ignoring security warnings
- Using for malicious purposes

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. **Do** contact the maintainer privately
3. **Include** detailed steps to reproduce
4. **Provide** any relevant logs or error messages
